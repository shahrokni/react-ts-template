# 🧠 How to run the app

This is a minimal yet production-ready Node.js + TypeScript + Express project.  
You can run it in **two different ways** — depending on your environment and preferences.

## 🚀 1. Run with Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- Docker Compose v2 (preferred) or legacy v1

> **Warning**
> If you're using Compose v1 (`docker-compose`), just replace `docker compose` with `docker-compose` in the commands below.

### Run the app:

```bash
sudo docker compose up --build
```

## 2. Run Locally Without Docker (Dev Mode)

**_The simplest way to start developing_**

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

# 🧪 How to run the tests

```bash
npm run test
```
